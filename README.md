"Brewed to Perfection" Hackathon

"A local coffee shop has hired you to design their website! They need a stylish, well-organized, and mobile-friendly site that reflects their brand. Focus on layout, typography, and visual storytelling to make their coffee shop stand out."

âœ… Your coffee shop website MUST include:

- A hero section with the coffee shopâ€™s name and tagline.

- A brief â€˜About Usâ€™ section introducing the shopâ€™s story.

- A menu section displaying coffee and pastry offerings (does not need to be connected to payment or cart).

- A contact section with a simple form (no backend needed).

- Choose fonts and colors that match the brandâ€™s identity.

ðŸ’¡ HTML/CSS Bonus Challenge Ideas:

- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to create an advanced layout.

- Add a testimonial section with quotes from happy customers.

- Design an alternate theme, like a "morning coffee" vs. "night cafÃ©" mode.

- Use CSS animations, hover effects, or transitions to enhance UI.

- Implement responsive design using media queries for mobile and desktop layouts.

ðŸ’¡ JavaScript Bonus Challenge Ideas:

- Add a "Coffee Quiz" that recommends drinks based on user input.

- Create a loyalty points tracker using local storage.

- Implement a countdown timer for a special deal or happy hour.

Judging Criteria:

- Visual Appeal & Branding â€“ Does the design match a coffee shop aesthetic?

- User Experience & Navigation â€“ Is the site easy to navigate and responsive?

- Creativity & Layout â€“ How well are the sections designed and structured?
